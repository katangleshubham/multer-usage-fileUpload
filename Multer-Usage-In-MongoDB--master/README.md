# Multer-Usage-In-MongoDB-
A simple demo showing how we can upload single and multiple files in mongodb using mongoose 

1.npm install mongodb 2.npm install mongoose

install all the node modules like node,express,path,fs etc

Create a empty folder and install all the dependencies then work in a structured manner.

Once you install node using npm install node node_packages folder will be created in the main folder .

**NOTE
Do not run without node or else error will be genrated.
Which is not present in the respositary i've created so do that first.
